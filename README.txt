To start game, run Gamestarter.py.  Not compatible with Python 3.

You are given a choice of two dungeons to fight through for upgraded
weapons and spells, followed by boss fights.  There is only one dungeon
in the final area.  You are given a choice to take either a left or right
path; you are given a slight hint as to what to expect from one of these
two paths. This game has no coherent plot or reasoning behind
its many strange baddies, but each enemy was made unique with its own
abilities and AI.  Difficulty grows as you beat dungeons, to avoid an
easy runthrough of the other dungeon choice.
